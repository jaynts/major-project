1. Client-Side Actors (Attack Source)
1.1 Source System (Attacker System)
CPU & Memory Usage: As the system creates several worker threads (NUM_WORKERS = 4), the system-running system will use intensive CPU and memory resources to process thousands of simultaneous requests.
Network Bandwidth: The system generates a high amount of outgoing HTTP traffic, putting network load on the client side.
IP Reputation & Blacklisting: Without proxies, the source IP can become blacklisted by target site security systems.
1.2 Internet Service Provider (ISP)
The ISP handles a large number of outgoing connections and can identify suspicious traffic patterns.
Some ISPs might use rate limiting or block the connection to avoid abuse.
2. Network Entities (Internet Infrastructure)
2.1 Proxy Servers (Intermediaries)
Rotating Proxies: The system employs a number of proxy servers to conceal request sources and evade detection.
Proxy Load & Performance: Thousands of requests fired via the proxies would saturate their capacity, causing connection failure or timeout.
Proxy Blacklisting: The targeted page might detect and block blacklisted proxy IPs, thereby decreasing their usefulness.
2.2 DNS Resolvers
The system fires repeated domain resolution requests for TARGET_URL, adding to DNS query load.
DNS providers can mark high-frequency lookups as abusive traffic (e.g., botnets, scrapers).
3. Server-Side Entities (Target System)
3.1 Web Server
Overload of Concurrent Connections: The system makes 20,000 HTTP requests that can overflow a web server's concurrent connections capacity.
Slower Response Time: Handling thousands of requests within a short period can lead to sluggish response for real users.
Chances of Down Time (Denial of Service - DoS): When the request queue in the server gets filled, the server hangs and causes service downtime.
3.2 Load Balancer (if available)
When the target site is behind a load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB, Nginx, Cloudflare), it will attempt to distribute the requests among many servers.
In high load, the balancer can throttle the requests, drop the connections, or trigger DDoS protection rules.
3.3 Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Behavioral Analysis: The WAF can recognize automated patterns (e.g., same requests with different user-agents but same intervals).
Blocking Mechanisms: Potential countermeasures are:
Rate limiting (requests per IP limitation).
IP blocking (in case proxies are suspicious).
Challenge-response mechanisms (e.g., CAPTCHA test).
4. Security & Compliance Risks
4.1 Rate Limiting & Bot Detection Systems
Websites implement anti-scraping protections (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA, Cloudflare Bot Management).
Proxy rotation and user-agent spoofing in the system try to evade bot detection, but advanced systems employ fingerprinting methods (e.g., analyzing request headers and behavioral signatures).
4.2 Legal & Ethical Implications
ToS Violation: Excessive automated requests are generally disallowed by most sites.
Potential Legal Consequences: Bulk scraping or DoS attacks can result in IP blocking, legal warnings, or lawsuits under laws like:
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (USA)
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU)
5. Effect on End-Users (Legitimate Users)
5.1 Deterioration of Web Sites' Performance
Long page loading, denied logins, or server unavailable errors (HTTP 503 - Service Unavailable) are tolerated by valid users.
5.2 False Lockouts and False Positives
When the application target is a login page, repeated repeated failure logins may lead legimate users having their accounts locked out.
Security policies based on IP, when applied, cause some valid users to be blocked along with automated requests.
